# Docker-UI
Hassle free monitoring, for your docker continers.


# The Problem 

Setting up monitoring for docker containers can be hard, and while exsising solutions do a great job, sometimes
you just need a simple interface to see whats going on at a glance. 


### This project aims to be that solution, by providing a neat web dashboard and an easy to use API.


# Note! This project is still under active development :construction:
